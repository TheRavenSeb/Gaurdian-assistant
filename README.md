To create effective documentation for getting started with your application, it's important to cover the basics of what your application does, how to set it up, and how to use it. Given the context of your code, which involves a speech recognition bot that listens for specific commands, here's a suggested structure for your documentation:

# Getting Started with Gaudian

Gaudian is a speech recognition bot designed to assist users with various tasks through voice commands. This guide will help you set up and use Gaudian in your environment.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- An internet connection for using Google's Speech Recognition service.

## Installation

1. **Install the SpeechRecognition library**: Gaudian uses the `SpeechRecognition` library for speech recognition. Install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    ```

2. **Clone or download the Gaudian repository**: If you're using a version control system like Git, clone the repository. Otherwise, download the source code.

3. **Navigate to the Gaudian directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've placed the Gaudian source code.

## Usage

1. **Run Gaudian**: To start using Gaudian, run the main script. In your terminal or command prompt, execute:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Activate Gaudian**: Say "Gaurdian" to activate the bot. Gaudian will start listening for commands.

3. **Commands**:
    - **Stop**: Say "stop" to stop the bot.
    - **Name**: Say "what is your name" to get a response from Gaudian.

4. **Deactivate Gaudian**: To deactivate Gaudian, simply say "stop".

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: If you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `SpeechRecognition`, ensure you have installed the library as described in the Installation section.
- **Internet Connection**: Gaudian requires an internet connection to use Google's Speech Recognition service. Ensure your device is connected to the internet.
